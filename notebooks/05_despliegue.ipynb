    "## Your first project\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start a new SPAI project is by running the `init` command, followed by the name you want to give to your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Code>\n",
    "spai init my-project\n",
    "</Code>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Replace `my-project` with the name you want for your project.\n",

    "Once the project is created, a new folder should be created with the name of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Every SPAI project follows the same structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "/my-project\n",
    " |- /scripts\n",
    "     |- /my-script-1\n",
    "        |- main.py\n",

    "  |- spai.vars.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scripts`, `apis`, `uis` and `notebooks` folders are where you will write your code. Each folder contains a subfolder for each of your scripts, APIs, UIs and notebooks, respectively. Each subfolder contains the code for the specific script, API, UI or notebook, as well as a `requirements.txt` file and a `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `spai.config.yaml` file contains the configuration for your project, which will tell SPAI how to run your project locally or deploy it in the cloud. For now, let's igonre the `spai.vars.json` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about the project structure [here](/docs/reference).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running your project locally\n",
    "\n",
    "> Before running your project for the first time, please make sure you do the following.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Install the required dependencies for the project.\n",
    "> <Code>spai install</Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate inside your project folder and run the following command to start your project locally:\n",
    "\n",
    "<Code>\n",
    "spai run\n",
    "</Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything works as expected, you should have a project running with the following services:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "/my-project\n",
    " |- /scripts\n",
    "     |- /downloader\n",
    "        |- main.py -> downloads latest Sentinel-2 images on a given AoI\n",
    "        |- requirements.txt\n",
    "     |- /analytics\n",
    "        |- main.py -> compute analytics on the downloaded images\n",
    "        |- requirements.txt\n",
    " |- /apis\n",
    "     |- /analytics\n",
    "        |- main.py -> serve the compute analytics through an API\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can interact with the APIs, notebook and UI at the specified ports on your localhost. The scripts will be running in the background every minute. You can check the logs of the services in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to modify the code and configuration to adapt it to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deploying your project in the cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying your project in the cloud is as easy as running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<Code>\n",
    "spai deploy\n",
    "</Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "But before, make sure you make the following two changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the `type` of the storage in `spai.config.yaml` to `s3`, so your data is stored in a cloud bucket.\n",
    "2. Change the command for the ui to `streamlit run main.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 80`, this is due to how streamlit works.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The first time that you run the `deploy` command, you will be asked to login if you haven't done it yet. You can also do it with the following command:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> <Code>spai auth login</Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the `deploy` command, you will get a URL to your dashboard where you can track the status of your project as well as get public URLs for your APIs, UIs and notebooks and access to the logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, you don't have to worry about setting up servers, databases, or any other infrastructure. We take care of that for you, provisioning the necessary resources in the cloud and managing them for you. You can focus on writing your code and let us take care of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manage your project\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your project is deployed, you can manage it with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieve a list of your projects in the cloud:\n",
    "\n",
    "<Code>\n",
    "spai list projects\n",
    "</Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieve a list of the services in a project:\n",
    "\n",
    "<Code>\n",
    "spai list services \"project-name\"\n",
    "</Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieve the logs of a service:\n",
    "\n",
    "<Code>\n",
    "spai logs \"project-name\" \"service-type\" \"service-name\"\n",
    "</Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stop the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "<Code>\n",
    "spai stop \"project-name\" \n",
    "</Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopping a project will stop all the running services, but your data will still be stored in the cloud. You can restart the project with the `deploy` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Delete the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "<Code>\n",
    "spai delete \"project-name\" \n",
    "</Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting a project will remove all the data stored in the cloud. This action is irreversible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's next?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have just scratched the surface of what you can do with SPAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue in this tutorial section to learn, for example, how to deploy a complete [Water Quality](/docs/tutorials/water-quality) or [Forest Monitoring](/docs/tutorials/forest-monitoring) service that you can completely automate and monetize easily with SPAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to dig deeper into the platform, you can check the [reference](/docs/reference) section to learn more about the different components of the platform, including the [CLI](/docs/reference/cli) and the Python [library](/docs/reference/lib) to build your own applications.\n"
