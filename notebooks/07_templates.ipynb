    "\n",
    "The first thing we are going to do is clone the forest monitoring template locally, and inspect its modules and details.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Remember that you need to have SPAI [installed](/docs/tutorials/getting-started) to be able to clone templates and be authenticated to deploy them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloning a SPAI template is as easy as running a single CLI command. In this case, we want to clone the `forest-monitoring` template.\n",

    "</Code>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Project structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The forest monitoring template structure follows the same [structure](/docs/reference) as a SPAI project, simply ready to be used. Let's see it.\n",

    "that they are ready to be executed and deploy a service for forest monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some files are a little more special and specific. In the `README` we have information about the template,\n",
    "such as what it is used for, what variables it needs and other important information for the service.\n",
    "On the other hand, and as you already know, the `spai.config.yaml` file contains the configuration for your project. Let's take a look.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "project: forest-monitoring-template   # name of the template\n",
    "storage:\n",

    "What we see are the different services that make up the forest monitoring template, and how they are configured.\n",
    "First of all we have the `storage` defined, then the `scripts`, first to download images and analyze them, then the `apis`,\n",
    "to be able to serve the results, and the `ui`, to be able to visualize the results. Everything is defined in this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to look at the `wait_for` within `scripts`. Here you define whether a script or a notebook should wait for another to finish before running, to ensure linear execution.\n",
    "In the example, the `forest-monitoring` script waits for the `downloader` to run and finish before running.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🚨 Important! By default, all the templates come with the storage type as `s3`, but you can change it to `local` to run it locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UIs\n",
    "\n",
    "UIs can be developed using Python or [Node](https://nodejs.org/en). By default the runtime is `python`, but `node` can be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop and deploy UIs with Python, for example with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), you simply need to add the relevant command to `spai.config.yml`. Make sure you use the correct command depending on whether you are working locally or in the cloud, as shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uis:\n",
    "  - name: map_streamlit # by default, runtime is python\n",
    "    command: streamlit run main.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 80 # for cloud deployment\n",
    "    # command: streamlit run main.py --server.address localhost # for local development\n",
    "    port: 8501\n",
    "    env:\n",
    "      ANALYTICS_URL: api.analytics\n",
    "      XYZ_URL: api.xyz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If, on the other hand, you prefer to develop your UI with Node, you should take the following into account. If you want to work locally, simply running `npm run dev` you can deploy your UI. However, if you want to deploy it in the cloud you will have to install [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and add a `deploy` command to the scripts of your `package.json`, as shown in the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```node\n",
    "\"scripts\": {\n",
    "\t\t\"deploy\": \"vite build && vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80\"\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you should just add the commands and runtime to your `spai.config.yml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uis:\n",
    "  - name: map\n",
    "    command: npm run deploy # for cloud deployment\n",
    "    # command: npm run dev # for local development\n",
    "    port: 5173\n",
    "    runtime: node\n",
    "    env:\n",
    "      ANALYTICS_URL: api.analytics\n",
    "      XYZ_URL: api.xyz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🚧 We are working on greater support for Node. Right now, environment variables in a `spai.vars.json` cannot be used in a UI developed with Node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least we have the `spai.vars.json` file. This file defines the global variables that the services needs to run,\n",
    "such as the areas of interest or the time interval in which you want to do the forest monitoring. Let's look at this file.\n",

    "For this template we simply have two variables: `AOI`, which is nothing more than the geometry in\n",
    "`GeoJSON` format of our area of ​​interest, and `DATES`, which is the time interval. These variables are given by default in the\n",
    "template so that it can be executed and deployed without having to worry about them, but of course you can change them freely.\n",
    "In the last section we will see how to do it.\n",

    "\n",
    "![image](/images/docs/forest-monitoring-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can interact with the APIs and UI at the specified ports on your localhost.\n",
    "The scripts will be running in the background every day. You can check the logs of the services in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deploying the template in the cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying your project in the cloud is as easy as running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<Code>\n",
    "spai deploy\n",
    "</Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "> The first time that you run the `deploy` command, you will be asked to login if you haven't done it yet. You can also do it with the following command:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> <Code>spai auth login</Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the `deploy` command, you will get a URL to your dashboard where you can track the status of your project as well as get public URLs for your APIs and UI and access to the logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, you don't have to worry about setting up servers, databases, or any other infrastructure. We take care of that for you, provisioning the necessary resources in the cloud and managing them for you. You can focus on writing your code and let us take care of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running a ready-to-use template\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything we have seen shows how easy it is to customize and deploy a service for forest monitoring with SPAI.\n",
    "But wouldn't it be incredible to be able to do the same thing we have done, without having to clone the template locally?\n",
    "Wouldn't it be fantastic to be able to deploy it to the cloud simply with a command?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, actually you can do it! All you have to do is add the `-t` flag to the command, either `run` or `deploy`, and add the name of the template.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following command does it all in one fell swoop: it clones the template and runs it locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Code>spai run -t forest-monitoring</Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "And what happens if we want to do it directly in the cloud? Very easy! Just use `deploy`!\n",
    "\n",
    "<Code>spai deploy -t forest-monitoring </Code>\n",
    "\n",
    "And voilà! We already have a service for forest monitoring in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Changing the variables of the template\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of SPAI templates is that they are reproducible anywhere in the world and at any time (as long as images are available!).\n",
    "So, we have to be able to change both the area of ​​interest of the template and the time interval. Of course this can be done, in two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manually edit the spai.vars.json\n",
    "\n",
    "The first option, and possibly the easiest, is to clone the template locally via `spai clone forest-monitoring` and then manually edit\n",

    "### Edit variables via CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "The second option is to edit the variables via CLI when executing a `spai run` or `spai deploy`, adding the `-v` flag to edit the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to edit the dates:\n",
    "\n",
